I am working on a transport tracking and management project where student can track university vehicle see notices and send feedback via mobile app. Admin on the other hand use web panel to manage vehicle, add employee information send trip, add fuel and meter entries add maintenance records send students query response. The system will generate kpl report and the admin can view and print them. The system generates automated kpl from distance calculate by havershine algorithm and from the fuel entry also manual kpl from the meter entry and fuel entry. And the gps unit is install on the vehicle that sends location data  on the via laravel api and store on database.
